*THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT PLUGIN*. Do not run it in production!
Contributions are welcome, of course.

## Building The Driver

This project has a go.mod definition. So you can clone it to whatever directory you want.
It is not necessary to setup a go path at all.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:pascomnet/nomad-driver-podman
cd nomad-driver-podman
./build.sh
```

## Runtime dependencies

- [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/downloads.html) 0.9+
- Linux host with `podman` installed

You need a varlink enabled podman binary and a system socket activation unit,
see https://podman.io/blogs/2019/01/16/podman-varlink.html. 

nomad agent, nomad-driver-podman and podman will reside on the same host, so you 
do not have to worry about the ssh aspects of podman varlink.

Ensure that nomad can find the plugin, see [plugin_dir](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/configuration/index.html#plugin_dir)

## Using the driver

The featureset is very limited. 
For now you can:

* use the jobs driver config to define the image for your container
* start/stop containers with default or customer entrypoint and arguments
* use nomad alloc data in the container. It's bind mounted to /nomad
* bind mount custome volumes into the container
* monitor the memory consuption
* monitor CPU usage (might be buggy)
* container memory is limited to configured value
* task config cpu value is used to populate podman CpuShares

### Driver Configuration

* volumes stanza:

  * enabled - Defaults to true. Allows tasks to bind host paths (volumes) inside their container. 
  * selinuxlabel - Allows the operator to set a SELinux label to the allocation and task local bind-mounts to containers. If used with _volumes.enabled_ set to false, the labels will still be applied to the standard binds in the container.

```
plugin "nomad-driver-podman" {
  config {
    volumes {
      enabled      = true
      selinuxlabel = "z"
    }
  }
}
```

* gc stanza:

    * container - Defaults to true. This option can be used to disable Nomad from removing a container when the task exits.

```
plugin "nomad-driver-podman" {
  config {
    gc {
      container = false
    }
  }
}
```


### Task Configuration

* **image** - The image to run, 

```
config {
  image = "docker://redis"
}
```

* **command** - (Optional) The command to run when starting the container.

```
config {
  command = "some-command"
}
```

* **args** - (Optional) A list of arguments to the optional command. If no *command* is specified, the arguments are passed directly to the container.

```
config {
  args = [
    "arg1",
    "arg2",
  ]
}
```

* **volumes** - (Optional) A list of host_path:container_path strings to bind host paths to container paths. 

```
config {
  volumes = [
    "/some/host/data:/container/data"
  ]
}
```

## Example job

```
job "redis" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type        = "service"

  group "redis" {
    task "redis" {
      driver = "podman"

        config {
          image = "docker://redis"
        }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500
        memory = 256
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```sh
nomad run redis.nomad

==> Monitoring evaluation "9fc25b88"
    Evaluation triggered by job "redis"
    Allocation "60fdc69b" created: node "f6bccd6d", group "redis"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "9fc25b88" finished with status "complete"

podman ps
